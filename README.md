The Tutorial Repo


My name is Josh, I'm trying to figure out how to code so that I can create things on the web. Right now, I'd like to work on a matching web app to help people find where a minor league affiliate of the favorite MLB club is playing. Then I'd like to work on a race results web app. Still trying to figure out how. 

Other ideas: An algorithim to match ratings of two different users to identify users with similar tastes. I think the best application would be to match a movie users rating with a critic and to identify which critic they should follow instead of just the aggregate on rotten tomatoes, etc.

A harm reduction app for drug users with an alert for potential overdoses. Something similar to: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.unh.cs.android.dopesafe&hl=en but also identifying what other useful information/services it could provide in order to gain momentum
