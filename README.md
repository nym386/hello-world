The Tutorial Repo


My name is Josh, I'm trying to figure out how to code so that I can create things on the web. Right now, I'd like to work on a matching web app to help people find where a minor league affiliate of the favorite MLB club is playing. Then I'd like to work on a race results web app. Still trying to figure out how.
